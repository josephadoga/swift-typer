### A game to test your typing speed

## Game Rules

- You have 99 seconds to enter as many words as possible.
- The game contains 90 words, randomized for each session.
- Enter a word in the input field, and a new word will appear instantly.
- Start a new game by pressing the 'Start' button, no need to reload the page.
- The remaining time and your number of hits/points are displayed.
- Background music plays when the game starts and stops when it ends.
- The game ends when time runs out or when you get all the words right.
